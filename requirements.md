Phenomenon: The target is "magnetically" attracted by and pulled to the pointer as the pointer moves towards the target.


1. configurable UI

- scaling: targets must always be displayed in exactly the same size (condition 16:9)
- modular and easy to configure
- config:
  - size of target(s)
  - strength of "magnetic" effect (how strongly is the target attracted? how fast does it move towards the pointer?)
  - shape of the target(s): rect/circle
  - color of the target(s)
  - number of targets
  - where to place the target(s)  
 
 
2. logging of data

- log as much as possible


3. pushing of logged data

- to the MI-Wiki


- as few extern libraries/frameworks as possible!
